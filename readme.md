#### Demo and example input

A demo report has been generated to demonstrate the organisation and features of analysis results. It can be accessed by clicking on the [Demo]({{ url_for('demo') }}) tab. To test the pipeline end-to-end, the example files (exported from PEAKs) can be downloaded from [here](/static/temp/Study%20by%20Son,%20Eric%20T.,%20et%20al.zip){:target="_blank"} and uploaded in the demo [initialiser]({{ url_for('initialiser') }}) module to run the analysis. The dataset provided and used to generate the demo report are from the recent immunopeptidomic study by Son, Eric T., et al. In addition, we attached [example input files](/static/temp/demo%20data%20from%20multiple%20softwares.zip){:target="_blank"} exported from other search engines, including Skyline, ProteinPilot, Spectronaut, and DIA-NN.
